# TFM

This is the code made for the TFM of Pablo González at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. This TFM is supervised by Pablo Catalán.


In this work we have built a simulator based on [toyLIFE](https://github.com/PabloCatalan/toylife), a C++ library created by Pablo Catalán that allows to simulate the iterations that occur inside a cell.

For this TFM we have built two simulators that can be found in the [simulations](simulations) folder. The [first simulator](simulations/simulation1) is a test simulator that allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the C++ language as well as to prove that the idea we had could give coherent results. 

The [second simulator](simulations/with_toyLife) is the main result of this work, a simulator that uses toyLIFE as an evolutionary simulation engine.


In the [archive folder](archive) we can find a first sketch of the simulator in python and the same code in C++.
